  * Removed the file cython_code.c from the repository, given that it depends on
    cython_code.pyx and should be created when the cython_code.so library is 
    created.

  * ***Important bug fix***: a tolerance map is given to the program 
    indicating how much a voxel is allowed to deviate from the target
    determinant. If the tolerance value for a voxel is 1, that means
    that the voxel is allowed to grow by 100%, or shrink by 50%. If the
    value is 2, the voxel is allowed to grow by 200%, or shrink by 67%.
    (a voxel is not allowed to collaps fully, because we could end up with 
    missing data, and going beyond that is a physically non-possible outcome)
    The code reflected things the other way around though. Given a tolerance
    value of 1, a voxel could grow by 50%, or shrink by 100%. This has been
    fixed.
  * Changed the default value of the tolerance allowed for each voxel
    from 0.02 to 0.000001; a more reasonable value for the kind of data
    we work with
  * Added a check to verify the dimension order of the input determinant
    file. The program would eventually crash if this was not z,y,x. Now
    the input file is changed to the z,y,x order before beginning all the
    calculations if it not already is.
  * Fixed a small bug in calculating the initial amount of difference
    between the target determinant and the determinant of the zero vector 
    field 
  * Correctly set the volume real range in the
    create_initial_deformation_grid program to 0.0, instead of
    -100,100

  * Updating the code, change from c/c++ to python using the pyminc interface
    the programs in the /src directory are currently not used anymore
  * Modularized steps, into separate programs
